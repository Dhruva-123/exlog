Thus far:

. Created a network that supposedly works for every single framework (but still doubtful of the range of its power)
. Tested against SKlearn tree structures. Passed the test.
. Need to test against Sklearn's SVMs and other models.
. Need to test against other frameworks. 
. 3-4 hours of testing and fixing might lead to working MVP.
